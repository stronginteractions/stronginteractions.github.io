In our fourth episode of "Stories Straight from the Heart of Matter," we discuss Lattice QCD—a method for calculating observables of the strong interaction using methods of statistical physics and advanced computing. We explore exactly how this works and the role Lattice QCD will play for the Electron-Ion Collider with our expert, [Professor Martha Constantinou](/guests/constantinou) of Temple University.
