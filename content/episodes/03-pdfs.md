In our third episode of stories straight from the heart of matter, we talk about the connections between the Electron-Ion Collider and High-Energy Physics, in particular parton distribution functions. What are parton distribution functions or short PDFs, how we extract them, and why they are of importance for Nuclear and High-Energy Physics, we learn from our expert, Dr. Tim Hobbs of Argonne National Laboratory.

* An [example global analysis of Quantum Chromodynamics](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1773096) by Tim and his research colleages gives an idea of the wealth of data being used in global analysis and the shape of PDFs as a function of x, Q2, and parton flavor.
